# ElderEase
The purpose of the ElderEase project is to design and develop a software platform that streamlines the management of in-home caregiving services for elderly individuals. This system aims to bridge the gap between families and caregivers by offering an efficient, transparent, and user-friendly solution tailored to the unique needs of elderly care.
